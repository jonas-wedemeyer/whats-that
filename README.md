## Overview

You draw, BUGY guesses. You have only 15 seconds per round to show off your artistic skills. Can BUGY understand what you are trying to draw? Let's get started!

This game is based on Google's [Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) game. Quick, Draw! is an A.I. Experiment by Google. The dataset of 50 million+ drawings means that it is the largest unique data set of doodles in the world. Developers can also use the dataset to train their own neural networks.

Install dependencies using npm:

`npm i`
